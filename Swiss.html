<font style="font-family:Californian FB;color:Black;font-size:30;">Switzerland, officially the Swiss
Confederation, is a landlocked country situated at the confluence of Western, Central, and Southern
Europe.It is a federal republic composed of 26 cantons, with federal authorities based in Bern.
Switzerland is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria
and Liechtenstein to the east.It is geographically divided among the Swiss Plateau, the Alps, and
the Jura, spanning a total area of 41,285 km (15,940 sq mi),and land area of 39,997 km (15,443 sq mi).</font><img src='https://geology.com/world/switzerland-map.gif' height=250 width=250>

<font style="font-family:Californian FB;color:Black;font-size:30;">Although the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately
8.5 million is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities and economic centres are
located, among them Zürich, Geneva, and Basel. These cities are home to several offices of international
organisations such as the headquarters of FIFA, the UN's second-largest Office, and the main building
of the Bank for International Settlements. The main international airports of Switzerland are also located
in these cities.More major ities include;Lausanne, Winterthur, Lucerne, St. Gallen.</font><img src='https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/styles/large-article-image-style-16-9/public/field/image/579261.jpg?itok=dZ4ya1Yt&c=b9a8e7745187a152e03c09f6d24fc3ca'width=400 height=300>

<font style="font-family:Californian FB;color:Black;font-size:30;">The establishment of the Old Swiss Confederacy dates to the late medieval period,
resulting from a series of military successes against Austria and Burgundy. Swiss independence from the
Holy Roman Empire was formally recognized in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. The Federal Charter of 
1291 is considered the founding document of Switzerland which is celebrated on Swiss National Day. 
Since the Reformation of the 16th century, Switzerland has maintained a strong policy of armed neutrality;
it has not fought an international war since 1815 and did not join the United Nations until 2002.
Nevertheless, it pursues an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in peace-building processes
around the world.Switzerland is the birthplace of the Red Cross, one of the world's oldest and best known
humanitarian organisations, and is home to numerous international organisations, including the United Nations
Office at Geneva, which is its second-largest in the world. It is a founding member of the European Free Trade
Association, but notably not part of the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Eurozone.
However, it participates in the Schengen Area and the European Single Market through bilateral treaties.</font><img src='https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Rs2PEQNSCUsfaB8cAAZNyw--~B/aD01ODc7dz04MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/reuters.com/bf335867ed3079463dd0bb39015ba9fa'width=340 height=400>


<font style="font-family:Californian FB;color:Black;font-size:30;">Switzerland occupies the crossroads of Germanic and Romance Europe, as reflected in its four main linguistic
and cultural regions: German, French, Italian and Romansh. Although the majority of the population are
German-speaking, Swiss national identity is rooted in a common historical background, shared values such
as federalism and direct democracy, and Alpine symbolism. Due to its linguistic diversity, Switzerland
is known by a variety of native names: Schweiz Suisse. On coins and stamps, the Latin name, Confoederatio Helvetica
– frequently shortened to "Helvetia" – is used instead of the four national languages.A developed country,
it has the highest nominal wealth per adult and the eighth-highest per capita gross domestic product,
and has been considered a tax haven.It ranks highly on some international metrics, including economic
competitiveness and human development. Its cities such as Zürich, Geneva, and Basel rank among the highest
in the world in terms of quality of life albeit with some of the highest costs of living in the world. In 2020,
IMD placed Switzerland first in attracting skilled workers. The World Economic Forum ranks it the 5th most competitive
country globally.The Swiss economy is characterised by a skilled and generally 'peaceful' workforce. One quarter of 
the country's full-time workers are unionised</font><img src='https://www.oecd.org/media/oecdorg/directorates/economicsdepartment/eo99/EO99SWITZ.PNG'width=400 height=290<br><br>
