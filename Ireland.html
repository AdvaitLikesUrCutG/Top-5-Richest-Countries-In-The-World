<font style="font-family:Californian FB;color:Black;font-size:30;">Ireland is an island in the
North Atlantic. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish
Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third
-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest on Earth.Geopolitically, Ireland is divided between 
the Republic of Ireland, which covers five-sixths of the island, and 
Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom.</font><img src='https://i.pinimg.com/originals/98/8a/7b/988a7b2cade76edaad6c8ca857ef2169.gif' width=350 height 400>

<font style="font-family:Californian FB;color:Black;font-size:30;">In 2011,the population of Ireland was about
6.6 million,ranking it the second most populous island in Europe after Great Britain. As of 2016,
4.8 million lived in Ireland.The geography
of Ireland comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain,with several
navigable rivers extending inland. Its vegetation is a product of its mild but changeable
climate which is free of extremes in temperature. Much of Ireland was woodland until the end of
the Middle Ages.Today,woodland makes up about 10% of the island.There are twenty-six
land mammal species native to Ireland.</font><img src='https://i.pinimg.com/736x/1a/a7/0d/1aa70d16331af5bd1f18ed934fcffd5d.jpg' width=350 height=350>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src='https://www.sustainability-times.com/wp-content/uploads/thumbs/puffins-2819126_960_720-39cnvwwasyqo4hrv4zb1mo.jpg' width=390 height=180>


<font style="font-family:Californian FB;color:Black;font-size:30;">The Irish climate is influenced by the Atlantic Ocean 
and thus very moderate, and winters are milder than expected for such a northerly area, although 
summers are cooler than those in continental Europe. Rainfall and cloud cover are abundant.Gaelic
Ireland had emerged by the 1st century AD. The island was Christianised from the 5th century 
onward. Following the 12th century Anglo-Norman invasion, England claimed sovereignty. However,
English rule did not extend over the whole island until the 16thâ€“17th century.In the 1690s, a system of Protestant English 
rule was designed to materially disadvantage the Catholic majority and Protestant dissenters, 
and was extended during the 18th century. With the Acts of Union in 1801, Ireland became a part 
of the United Kingdom. A war of independence in the early 20th century was followed by the partition 
of the island, creating the Irish Free State, which became increasingly sovereign over the following 
decades, and Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland saw 
much civil unrest from the late 1960s until the 1990s. This subsided following a political agreement
in 1998.In 1973 the Republic of Ireland joined the European Economic Community while Britain and Northern Ireland were also joining.</font><img src='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fJ8VnMzxoIA/maxresdefault.jpg'width=400 height=300>

<font style="font-family:Californian FB;color:Black;font-size:30;">Irish culture has had a 
significant influence on other cultures, especially in the field of literature. Alongside mainstream 
Western culture,a strong indigenous culture exists,as expressed through Gaelic games, Irish music, 
Irish language and Irish dance.The island's culture shares many features with that of Great Britain, 
including the English language, and sports such as football,rugby,horse racing,golf,and boxing.The culture of Ireland also includes language, literature, music, art,and cuisine.</font><img src='https://www.cravebits.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/A-picture-showing-about-Irish-culture-in-breif.jpg'width=400 height=400<br><br>
